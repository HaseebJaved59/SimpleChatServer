SimpleChatServer is a basic multi-client chat application implemented in Java. This project demonstrates a client-server communication system where multiple clients can connect to a server, send messages, and have them broadcast to all other connected clients.

## Features

- **Client-Server Architecture**: Clients connect to the server and communicate via message broadcasting.
- **Multithreading**: The server handles multiple clients simultaneously using threads.
- **Message Broadcasting**: Messages from a client are broadcast to all other connected clients.
- **Client ID**: Each client has a unique ID that is sent to the server to identify messages.
